				<p>A September 8 news release from the UK’s University of East Anglia (UEA) details the findings of a recent study conducted by researchers, which show that rising ocean temperatures will interrupt the natural cycles of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and phosphorous – in addition to having a direct impact on the plankton ecosystem of the world’s oceans.  The findings appear in Nature Climate Change in an article entitled, "The impact of temperature on marine phytoplankton resource allocation and metabolism."</p>

			<p>As plankton play an important role in the natural carbon cycle of the world’s oceans – by removing nearly half of all atmospheric CO2 during photosynthesis and storing it in the ocean depths for hundreds of years – ocean warming will negatively impact plankton colonies, resulting in a rough cycle of climate change.  So, researchers from the School of Environmental Sciences and the School of Computing Sciences at UEA assessed microscopic phytoplankton, which rely on photosynthesis to reproduce and grow, to understand more fully the potential impact of ocean warming.</p>

				<p>"Phytoplankton, including micro-algae, are responsible for half of the carbon dioxide that is naturally removed from the atmosphere," said lead researcher Dr. Thomas Mock.  "As well as being vital to climate control, it also creates enough oxygen for every other breath we take, and forms the base of the food chain for fisheries so it is incredibly important for food security."</p>

				<p>In addition, Mock said, "Previous studies have shown that phytoplankton communities respond to global warming by changes in diversity and productivity.  But with our study we show that warmer temperatures directly impact the chemical cycles in plankton, which has not been shown before."</p>

				<p>Along with colleagues from the University of Exeter, the researchers produced computer models to create a simulated global ecosystem that incorporated global ocean temperatures, 1.5 million plankton DNA sequences acquired from samples and biochemical data.</p>

				<p>"We found that temperature plays a critical role in driving the cycling of chemicals in marine micro-algae. It affects these reactions as much as nutrients and light, which was not known before," said Mock.</p>

				<p>"Under warmer temperatures, marine micro-algae do not seem to produce as many ribosomes as under lower temperatures," he added. "Ribosomes join up the building blocks of proteins in cells.  They are rich in phosphorous and if they are being reduced, this will produce higher ratios of nitrogen compared to phosphorous, increasing the demand for nitrogen in the oceans.  This will eventually lead to a greater prevalence of blue-green algae called cyanobacteria which fix atmospheric nitrogen."</p>

				<p>Funding for this research was provided by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), 454 Life Sciences (Roche), the Leverhulme Trust, the European Union (FP7), the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the Earth and Life Systems Alliance (ELSA).</p>
