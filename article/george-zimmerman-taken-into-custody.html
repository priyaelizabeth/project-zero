				<p>George Zimmerman has been taken into custody following an incident that may have involved a gun, CBS News has confirmed.</p>

			<p>	In a telephone interview the Lake Mary, Florida police chief said George Zimmerman was in "investigative detention" after his estranged wife, Shellie, called authorities to say he was threatening her and her parents with a gun. She later backed off from that statement, saying she never saw a gun despite what she told the 911 dispatcher.</p>

				<p>Lake Mary police say they were called to the Sprucewood Road home of Shellie Zimmerman's parents Monday afternoon. Lake Mary Police Chief Steve Bracknell told CBS News officers did not see a gun when they arrived on scene. </p>

				<p>As of 3:45 p.m., George Zimmerman was no longer in custody, reports CBS affiliate WKMG. Police said they assumed a gun was in Zimmerman's car, but they don't plan on getting a warrant to look or retrieve it.</p>

			<p>	"He's in his car and he continually has his hand on his gun and he keeps saying 'step closer' and he's just threatening all of us," Shellie Zimmerman said in a 911 call, reports the station, adding that George Zimmerman was "trying to shut the garage door" on her.</p>

				<p>"He punched my dad in the nose my dad has a mark on the nose. I saw his glasses were on the floor," Shellie Zimmerman said in the call. "He then accosted my father then took my iPad out of my hands. He then smashed it and cut it with a pocketknife, and there is a Lake Mary city worker across the street that I believe saw all of it."</p>

			<p>	Shellie Zimmerman tells her father on the call to get behind a car. "I don't know if he's going to start shooting at us or something," she says in the call.</p>

				<p>She said her father "feels like he's going to have a heart attack." She requested medical attention for her father, saying it looked as though his nose may be broken.</p>

			<p>	"I don't know what he's capable of," Shellie Zimmerman said in the call. "I'm really scared."</p>

				<p>Lake Mary police spokesman Zach Hudson tells the station police are "trying to determine what exactly happened."</p>

				<p>No arrests have been made. The estranged husband and wife are blaming each other for starting the fight, police said, though Shellie Zimmerman has said she won't press charges. </p>


				<p>Police are investigating the incident as a  "possible domestic battery," the Orlando Sentinel reports. No significant injuries were reported, police said, according to the report.</p>

				<p>The incident comes days after Shellie Zimmerman filed for divorce and discussed her relationship with George Zimmerman in a TV interview.</p>

				<p>George Zimmerman, 29, was acquitted of second-degree murder in the Feb. 2012 shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin on July 13. The case made international news after it took police several weeks to arrest Zimmerman in the case.</p>

			<p>	Shellie Zimmerman has also had trouble with the law. On Aug. 28, she pleaded guilty to misdemeanor perjury and was sentenced to one year of probation. She had been accused of lying about the couple's financial situation when she testified at George Zimmerman's bond hearing in June 2012.</p>

			<p>	On the same day she pleaded guilty, Shellie Zimmerman told ABC's Good Morning, America that she would "think about" staying married to her husband.</p>

				<p>Zimmerman has been pulled over for speeding twice since his acquittal.</p>
