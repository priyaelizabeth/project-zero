				<p>Western social media sites are outlawed for ordinary Iranians, but Iran's new government is using them keenly in a concerted drive to improve the Islamic republic's image.</p>

				<p>Spearheading the cyber charm offensive is the president, Hassan Rouhani, and his US-educated foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who garnered global attention last week when he used his new English-language Twitter account to wish Jews a happy new year and to proclaim that his country does not deny the Holocaust.</p>

				<p>A day earlier, a tweet from an account in Mr Rouhani's name wished "all Jews" a "blessed" new year on the holiday of Rosh Hashanah.
				Iran's entire cabinet has also opened Facebook pages in recent weeks.</p>

				<p>The public diplomacy drive is preparing the ground for key events. Tehran is due in coming weeks to resume talks on its nuclear programme with six world powers, including the United States.
				Mr Rouhani, who is regarded as a moderate pragmatist, transferred the handling of those negotiations last week to Mr Zarif's foreign ministry, taking the portfolio away from hardline officials.</p>

				<p>And later this month, Mr Rouhani will make his debut on the international stage when he addresses the United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>

				<p>The Jewish new year greetings were clearly aimed at distancing his administration from that of his predecessor. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's denials of the Holocaust made him toxic to western public opinion, fuelled fears over Tehran's nuclear ambitions and embarrassed many Iranians.</p>

				<p>"The Rouhani team is eager to quickly undo the eight years of damage that the Ahmadinejad government did to Iran's standing and image," said Trita Parsi, the president of the National Iranian American Council, an advocacy group. "In this new age, you can at times reach more people through a tweet than through a press release, and Rouhani and Zarif have shown that they know that."</p>

				<p>On his Facebook page, which has 150,000 likes, Mr Zarif has also nudged Iran's public stance on Syria - a long-standing Tehran ally - in a more moderate direction. He condemned the use of chemical weapons by any side in the civil war while urging the US not to attack Syria.</p>

				<p>Nearly all of the candidates in Iran's presidential election in June, hardliners included, used social media as a campaign tool. "Now Rouhani and Zarif are using them for the new president's approach of engagement and moderation," said Scott Lucas, an Iran expert at Birmingham University in England.</p>

				<p>Mr Zarif's Twitter page, launched last Wednesday, already has 15,000 followers.</p>

				<p>The new year messages received wide and mostly positive coverage in leading US media. CNN's Christiane Amanpour tweeted enthusiastically last Thursday that she had just spoken to Mr Zarif, who confirmed "that he is tweeting and wishes Jews in Iran and around the world a happy new year".</p>

				<p>Mr Zarif reinforced those messages in a polite and lively exchange on Twitter with Christine Pelosi, the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader of the US house of representatives, during which he said: "Iran never denied it [the Holocaust]. The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone."</p>

				<p>	Their friendly interaction in cyberspace was remarkable, given that Tehran has not had diplomatic relations with Washington for more than three decades.</p>

				<p>However, Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Saban Center at the Brookings Institution in Washington, struck a sceptical note about Iran's flirtation with social media. "Mr Rouhani deserves real credit for beginning to change the discourse of Iranian politics," she said.</p>

				<p>"Still, the media frenzy over a handful of tweets seems a bit excessive. Iran's Islamic Republic has managed to maintain the largest population of Jews in the Middle East living outside the state of Israel, and its leadership has been known to issue munificent statements toward the community on a semi-regular basis."</p>

				<p>Facebook and Twitter are the most popular social networking sites in Iran, just two among many that the regime blocks or filters. Millions of tech-savvy Iranians flout the ban by using anti-filtering tools and proxy servers.</p>

				<p>Many Iranian officials, including the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have a presence, albeit mostly unofficial, on western social media. But the Rosh Hashanah tweets have ignited a debate in Iran's ruling establishment over whether officials should use such tools.</p>

				<p>Some hardliners are strongly opposed.</p>

				<p>Iran imposed a ban on Facebook after the disputed re-election of Mr Ahmadinejad in 2009, when his opponents used social media to organise protests.</p>
