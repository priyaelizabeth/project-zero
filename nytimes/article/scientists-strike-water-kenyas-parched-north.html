				<p>The Kenyan government and UNESCO on Wednesday announced the discovery of a huge supply of underground water in the impoverished, drought-stricken extreme north of the country.</p>

				<p>The find, made using advanced satellite exploration technology and backed up by UNESCO drilling, was hailed as a scientific breakthrough that could radically change the lives of the half-million people living in one of the world's most arid regions.</p>

				<p>Two aquifers -- underground layers of permeable rock or silt soaked in water -- were found in the Turkana region, the scene of a devastating drought two years ago that aid workers said pushed malnutrition rates up to 37 percent.</p>

				<p>"The news about these water reserves comes at a time when reliable water supplies are highly needed," said Judi Wakhungu, cabinet secretary in the Kenyan ministry of environment, water and natural resources.</p>

				<p>"This newly found wealth of water opens a door to a more prosperous future for the people of Turkana and the nation as a whole. We must now work to further explore these resources responsibly and safeguard them for future generations," Wakhungu said at the start of a water security conference in Nairobi.</p>

				<p>The firm which carried out the survey, Radar Technologies International (RTI), said the area hosts a minimum reserve of 250 billion cubic meters of water, which is recharged at a rate of 3.4 billion cubic meters per year -- almost equivalent to annual water consumption in Austria.</p>

				<p>"Hundreds of thousands of livestock die because of recurring droughts. This won't happen anymore," RTI president Alain Gachet told AFP.</p>

				<p>"We've just doubled the country's drinking water reserves. The needs are huge, as women often have to walk 10 to 20 kilometres to get water."</p>

				<p>RTI said the largest find -- the Lotikipi Basin Aquifer, located west of Lake Turkana -- was roughly the size of the US state of Rhode Island.</p>

				<p>The smaller Lodwar Basin Aquifer, meanwhile, could feed the parched regional capital of Lodwar -- although UNESCO cautioned that water quality still needed to be assessed.</p>

				<p>The hostile and desert-like Turkana region, near the northern border with Uganda, South Sudan and Ethiopia, is the poorest in the country, and its mostly-nomadic people are among the most vulnerable in Africa.</p>

				<p>Fighting between rival groups -- often armed with guns -- over grazing land for their livestock is common in the region.</p>

				<p>Of Kenya's 41 million strong population, 17 million lack access to safe water, and 28 million do not have adequate sanitation.</p>

				<p>Kenya's northern region already hosts Lake Turkana -- the world's biggest desert lake stretching 250 kilometres (150 miles) long by 60 kilometres wide at its largest point -- but the famous jade-coloured waters are threatened by hydroelectric dams cutting off feeder streams in neighbouring Ethiopia.</p>

				<p>But water is not the only resource under the ground, with exploratory oil drilling ongoing.</p>
